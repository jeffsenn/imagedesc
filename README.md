Uses Ollama/Llava (but could be adapted for others) on a Mac to enhance image files with EXIF descriptions and Keywords

Note - everything runs locally on Mac (requires a fair bit of RAM) - no remote API calls are made, nor data shared with anyone.

Requires: exiftool, Ollama, python3 (no special libs)
